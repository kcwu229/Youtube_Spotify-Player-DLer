# Youtube_Spotify-Player-DLer Beta 
(The listen mode is still in progress, which can only provide simple play and pause)

To use, first you need to install ffmpeg in https://ffmpeg.org/download.html. And I am trying to find solution to tackle this problem.

Looking for a awesome music downloader? Maybe you can try this Youtube_Spotify-Player-DLer
We provide two modes: Downloading and Listening.

You can choose either downloading Spotify or Youtube platform each time, by entering link to entry and pressing the corresponding button and waiting for the downloading.

With a message and notifaction sound, your musics are ready for you! (Spped depends on your network and quantiry)
